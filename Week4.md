# Week 4

Outcomes from previous week:
- The students should finished the FastFrames tutorial.
- They read the calibration paper again, and extracted the relevant selection cuts that we should look for the calibration.

Discussion:
- The students presented slides.
- We clarified a couple of things about the tutorial.

Plan for next week:
- Diego will give the students access to the new datasets.
- The students will start implementing selection cuts based on the calibration paper.
- Diego will help Peter to setup his coding environment.
