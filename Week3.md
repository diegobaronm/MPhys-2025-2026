# Week 3

Outcomes from previous week:
- The students were able to login into LxPlus and start doing the FastFrames tutorial.
- They read the calibration paper again putting emphasis on the different flavour tagging algorithms ATLAS has used over the years.

Discussion:
- The students presented slides.
- We discussed the different flavour tagging algorithms used in ATLAS and their main features.
- Some coding tools were also discussed in order to make working on the project simpler.

Plan for next week:
- The students should finish the FastFrames tutorial.
- The students should read the calibration paper section that describes the event selection.
- They should start implementing the selection and analysis worflow, and start generating some plots.

## Material:

### Coding:
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev) the nice terminal program.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the [ROOT viewver](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=albertopdrf.root-file-viewer) extension.

### Reading:

[Section 6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05120) of the calibration paper contains the event selection we want to implement.
